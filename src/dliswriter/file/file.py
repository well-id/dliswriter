        The Data Descriptor Reference of the FDATA Logical Record refers to a Frame Object (...)
        and defines the Frame Type of the Frame.
        Frames of a given Frame Type occur in sequences within a single Logical File.
        A Frame is segmented into a Frame Number, followed by a fixed number of Slots that contain Channel samples,
        one sample per Slot. The Frame Number is an integer (Representation Code UVARI) specifying the numerical order
        of the Frame in the Frame Type, counting sequentially from one. All Frames of a given Frame Type record the same
        Channels in the same order. The IFLRs containing Frames of a given Type need not be contiguous.

        A Frame Type may or may not have an Index Channel. If there is an Index Channel, then it must appear first
        in the Frame and it must be scalar. When an Index Channel is present, then all Channels in the Frame are assumed
        to be "sampled at" the Index value. For example, if the Index is depth, then Channels are sampled at the given
        depth; if time, then they are sampled at the given time, etc. (...)

        The truth of the assumption just stated is relative to the measuring and recording system used and does not
        imply absolute accuracy. For example, depth may be measured by a device that monitors cable movement
        at the surface, which may differ from actual tool movement in the borehole. Corrections that are applied
        to Channels to improve the accuracy of measurements or alignments to indices are left to the higher-level
        semantics of applications.

        When there is no Index Channel, then Frames are implicitly indexed by Frame Number.'
